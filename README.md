</div>
A simple extension that was made to manage every opened tab while running Chromium-based browser. This way, when you have huge number of tabs opened at the same time, you could note it down, manage them, and that will help you to modify/reduce as much tabs as possible.

## HOW-TO INSTALL
Here's the instructions on how you can use the extension:
1. Clone/download this repository first.
2. Open any of your favorites Chromium-based browser.
3. Navigate to browser extension page, for example in Google Chrome it was `chrome://extensions/`. The URL could differ on other browsers.
4. Enable **Developer mode** in the extension page.
5. You should see **Load unpacked** button. Click the button and select root directory of this extension.

Please note that this project is still far from great, as it was started as a hobby project. Many features will be added when I have the time to maintain it again.
